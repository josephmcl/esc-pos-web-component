# ESC/POS Web Component

Access USB [ESC/POS][3] printers in the browser using [WebUsb][1] and [Web Components][2]!

## Motivation

This is just a fun project for now. Some goals of the project might be:

- Markdown like syntax for invoking character styles (e.g. underline, double wide, etc.)
- Loading emojis or other common characters into the device's memory
- Drawing images
